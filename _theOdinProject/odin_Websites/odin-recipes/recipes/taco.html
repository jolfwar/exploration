    <h1>TACOS</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tacos are a popular dish in America, where they are often served as a crunchy or soft shell filled with 
        seasoned ground beef or chicken, lettuce, cheese, and tomato salsa. The tortillas are usually made of flour 
        and are crispy, adding a pleasant crunch to the dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        The filling of tacos is well-seasoned and slightly spicy, with a combination of spices such as cumin, 
        chili powder, and garlic powder. The toppings add freshness and texture, with the lettuce adding a crisp crunch, 
        and the salsa providing a tangy and zesty flavor. The overall taste of Americanized tacos is savory and satisfying, 
        with a perfect balance of flavors and textures. Visually, they are colorful and appealing, with a variety of 
        toppings that make them look appetizing and tempting.
